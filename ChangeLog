Google Authenticator for Android ChangeLog


v2.21

* Enabled the app to generate correct time-based (TOTP) verification codes
  even on devices where the system time is wrong. The user can synchronize
  the app's internal time with Google servers using Settings ->
  Time correction for codes -> Sync now.
  NOTE: This feature adds requirement for the Full Internet Access
  permission.
* Made the countdown indicator and the Get Next Code button on Gingerbread
  and below green instead of gray.
* Fixed a bug where parsing a HOTP account provisioning URL with an invalid
  counter crashed the app.


v2.15

* Changed package name from com.google.android.apps.authenticator to
  com.google.android.apps.authenticator2 and changed the signing key.
  This is a new app as far as the Android OS and Google Play are concerned.
  The app securely imports data from the "old" app (v0.91).
* Made the app's UI look more native. The blue on black theme has been
  replaced with the system default (dark) theme.

  separate Add Account screen.

  browser (otpauth://...).


v0.91

  main screen of the app. The notice urges users to switch to the new
  Authenticator app (com.google.android.apps.authenticator2).

  screen.


v0.86

* Roll back v0.85 functionality making the app effectively equivalent to
  v0.73.

  with an empty name.

  when TOTP codes refresh.

v0.65

* Added support for Cupcake and Donut (Android 1.5 and 1.6 respectively).
* Dropped "Google" from the application title visible in the launcher and
  application list.
* Made the refresh time of TOTP codes independent of application start time.
* Replaced the textual "Get code" button for HOTP accounts with a clickable
  refresh icon.

  jumped backwards when the application was visible.


v0.64

  MANAGE_ACCOUNTS permissions that were introduced in v0.62 of the
  application.

* Fixed the bug where the "Illegal character" error message in the Manual
  Account Entry screen was not translated.

  scan result.


v0.62

* Remove the "Refresh" menu item for refreshing TOTP verification codes.
* Disable suggestions and upper-casing in the "Enter key" field in the "Manual
  account entry" screen.

  of updating the status message on the bottom of the screen.

  were updated (every 30 seconds).
