# Secure Authenticator

There is nothing particular spectacular about Secure Authenticator. It is a fork of Google Authenticator 2.21, the last posted open source release. The goal is simply to ensure I am using an open source application for 2FA, and it does not have more permissions than it needs.

I have disabled the INTERNET permission, and with it the time sync feature which was only useful for devices with incorrect system times. I have de-Google-branded the app, and changed the package name to avoid conflicts.
